        We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
        I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
        I  couldn't be there even when I tried
        You  don't believe it, we do this every time
        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something
        I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away, run away
